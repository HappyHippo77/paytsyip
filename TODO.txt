- The word “eltu” has the definitions for “eltu si”, probably replicable on other words.
    This is because reykunyu stores si verbs in its dictionary with the same "na'vi" entry as the original word,
    causing the original word to be overwritten immediately with the value of the si verb in reykunyu_py. The
    only way that I can think of to fix this would be to completely reformat the dictionary in reykunyu_py and
    change Paytsyìp to match.
